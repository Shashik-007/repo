             I am excited to learn about how the internet works and how to develop websites. 
             A year ago, I enrolled in an online web development bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu,
             where I learned about the fundamentals of developing websites and completed some mini-projects. 
             Ever since then, I have wanted to explore this domain more intricately. 
             Hence, despite being on the Data Analytics track, I chose to pursue the course as an elective. 
             I hope to gain further insights into the web development domain this semester.
